    <h1>About Knitworthy</h1>
    <p>In the knitting/crochet/fiber arts community, someone who appreciates a handmade gift and takes care of it is considered "knitworthy." However, many gift recipients do not undertand the effort that went into their handmade gifts. Knitworthy generates fun facts about the time and yarn that went into a project to put this into perspective.</p>
